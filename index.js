// Part 2: Practical Math

// The distance of the trip, in total, is 1,500 miles.
// Your carâ€™s fuel efficiency is as follows:
// At 55 miles per hour, you get 30 miles per gallon.
// At 60 miles per hour, you get 28 miles per gallon.
// At 75 miles per hour, you get 23 miles per gallon.
// You have a fuel budget of $175.
// The average cost of fuel is $3 per gallon.
// Set up a program to answer the following questions:
// How many gallons of fuel will you need for the entire trip?
// Will your budget be enough to cover the fuel expense?
// How long will the trip take, in hours?
